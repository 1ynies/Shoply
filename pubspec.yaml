# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/svg/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
flutter_native_splash:
  # The color of the splash screen background (your lime green)
  color: "#BBF451"
  # The path to your app's logo image
  image: "lib/assets/images/app_logo_backgroundless.png"

  # Optional: Configure branding text (the "Shop smarter" tagline)
  # This section requires some text/image setup in the native files,
  # but you can use branding to center the logo higher.
  # branding: "Shop smarter"
   # You could create an image with the "Shoply" and "Shop smarter" text together.
  # OR use a simple branding text:
  # branding: "Shop smarter"

  # Optional: Configuration for Android 12 and above (new splash screen API)
  android_12:
    image: "lib/assets/images/app_logo_backgroundless.png"
    # Ensure this image only contains the icon, as Android 12 handles the background color automatically.

  # Optional: Configure for iOS
  ios: true



flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "icon_app" # Optional, specifies the name of the icon asset on Android
  ios: true                # Set to true to generate icons for iOS
  image_path: "lib/assets/images/app_icon.png" # The path to your icon file
